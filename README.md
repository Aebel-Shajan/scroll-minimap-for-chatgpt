I made this extension because I kept getting lost during my conversations with chatgpt. Sometimes chatgpt be giving you alot of useless info you didnt ask for. Navigating through what it says and finding the useful bits can be pretty tedious. This extension aims to solve that.

## Usage
1. Download the extension from [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scroll-minimap-for-chatgp/apekbedjllgmacohbcckgipfhjddehkf)

2. Restart chrome

3. Go to chatgpt, you should see a toggle button for the minimap in the top right corner. Open the minimap by pressing this button.

4. Ask chatgpt a message and hit refresh minimap. A condensed view of the conversation should be shown in the minimap.
